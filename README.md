# Clauss_process

Clauss process contains from 2 devices - burner where SO2 is created from H2S with 02 and reactors (typically three) where SO2 reacts with H2S and sulfur is a product. Usualy the highest between reactors are coolers where sulfur is collected - first reactor has the hightest temperature (with increasing number of reactor temperaature drops). Sulfur is collected modification between S2 to S8 - higher modification (S6, S7, S8) prefers lower temperature. Cooler is not calculated due to unknown cp, dHcondensation, dHpolymerization.
